    10: 'The school feature was never intended to feel like something you are forced to do for its rewards, but rather as an option to spend spare time for a little boost. I am making a few changes to the reward systems of this feature to make school more optional, especially in the early game where time skipping is much more valuable.',
    11: 'Golden dust gain reduced if your global level is below 250 (linear)',
    12: 'The "Know-it-all" achievement is now secret, which means it does not contribute to gem gain or "Overachiever"',

    // v1.1.0
    14: 'Last patch I already introduced some band-aid solutions to address the school system. While they did help a little in making the game less about grinding school all the time, they did not fix the underlying issues. This rework is aimed at reducing the amount of time pressure some players felt, and removing the grind aspects while still keeping school as an occasional option to get golden dust. After all, Gooboo is supposed to be a long-term idle game, not an active incremental. This was also a great opportunity to clean up the intransparent system of elo and grades.',

    25: 'Exam mode: You have 1m 15s to reach the best score you can. At the end, you get golden dust based on your performance and chosen grade',
    26: 'Exam passes, they are needed to take exams. Get more daily or by raising your global level, exceeding the capacity converts it to golden dust',
    27: 'Reduced the amount of grades (removed -- and ++, as well as F- and F+), and adjusted difficulty to be about 2/3 of a full grade lower (if you had a C-- before you can now expect to reach C+)',
    28: 'Math optimal score requirement',
    29: 'Pressing answer in the math minigame with an empty text field no longer counts as a mistake',
    30: 'Literature optimal score requirement',
